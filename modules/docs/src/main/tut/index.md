**FOR USERS**

- **It's easier to find apps when they are grouped in Collections**

9Cards auto-categorizes your apps into smart Collections. You also can explore different Collections created and shared by other users in order to discover new ways to use your smartphone

- **Every moment of the day is different using Moments**

We called Moments to the parts in your day a day that use the phone for something in particular. Listen music, relax at your home, working at the office… Moments allow you to select the widgets associated with the particular moment in the day you’re in.

- **Apps are important, your Contacts too**

Our App Drawer hides many behaviors focused on your productivity. With a simple gesture, you can access to your contacts, filter your apps by recently installed or see your missed calls. By the way, you also can search in Google Play directly


FOR DEVELOPERS

- **Functional Programing also in the client side**

9 Cards App has been developed with Scala emphasizing in a Functional Architecture within an imperative world. 9 Cards doesn't use Android libraries for views; the project only uses the Android SDK, and all views and business logic have been created in Scala.

- **A modern architecture in Backend using Free Monads**

The server app architecture is based on free monads. A Free Monad is a data type that allows the decoupling of program declaration from program interpretation. This means you can use Free monads and Free applicatives to completely describe a program’s business logic.

- **9 Cards  would not be possible without the Scala Libraries**

We are using the most popular Scala libraries in the client and backend, for instance: Cats, Monix, Doobie, scalaZ, scalacheck and so on, and frameworks as Spray on the server side. Our goal has been to create a similar architecture in client and server using these amazing libraries of the Scala Ecosystem.
