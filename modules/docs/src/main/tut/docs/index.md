# Introduction

In 2014 we created 9 Cards App 1.0, a new Launcher concept for Android applications. 9 Cards is a customizable Home Launcher designed to improve your Android experience by organizing your apps and adapting to your daily routine. 

For 9 Cards 2.0, we have three primary goals:

 * Use the Scala programming language, instead of Java in order to provide the community with a real application built in Scala with a user base of thousands. 
 * Use a functional approach in a world where most people work in an imperative way.
 * Use a similar architecture in both the client-side and the backend.
