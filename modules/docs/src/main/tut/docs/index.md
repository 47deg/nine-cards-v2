# Introduction

In 2014 we created 9 Cards App 1.0 a new Launcher concept for Android applications. 9 Cards is a customizable Home Launcher to improve your Android experience organizing your apps and adapting to daily routine. 

For 9 Cards 2.0 we have 3 main goals:

 * Use Scala instead of Java in order to provide to the community a real application made in Scala with thousand of users
 * Use a functional approach in a world where all people work in imperative way
 * Use similar architecture in client and backend
